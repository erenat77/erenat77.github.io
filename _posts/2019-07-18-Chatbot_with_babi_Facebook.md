Chatbot by using the babi dataset released by Facebook research and there's a link below.
[facebook_babi](https://research.fb.com/downloads.babi)

The type of data we're going to be working with has three main components.
It has a story component.
1. Story
2. Question
3. Answer (Yes/No)

Here is an example.

           ## 1. Read the image and format the image as array with openCV library
            ```python
              import numpy as np

              def test_func(x,y):
                return np.sum(x,y)
            ```

            ## 2. Read the image and format the image as array with openCV library

            ### H3 Heading

            Here's some basic text.

            And here's some *italics*

            Here's some **bold** texts.

            What about a [link](https://github.com/erenat77)

            Here's a bulleted list:
            * First
            + seconds
            - Third

            Here is numbered list
            1. First
            2. second
            3. Third

            Python code block:
            ```python
              import numpy as np

              def test_func(x,y):
                return np.sum(x,y)
            ```

            Here is some inline code `x+y`.
