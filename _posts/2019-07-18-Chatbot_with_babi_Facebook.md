Chatbot by using the babi dataset released by Facebook research and there's a link below.\n

The type of data we're going to be working with has three main components.
It has a story component.
1. Story
2. Question
3. Answer (Yes/No)

Here is an example.

Please check the following paper called "End-to-End Memory Networks"\n
[End-to-End Memory Networks](https://research.fb.com/downloads.babi)

Overall of the model :

This is how I created the models
1. Input Memory Representation
2. Output Memory Representation
3. Generating Final Prediction
Eventually, created a **RNN** model with multiple layers
