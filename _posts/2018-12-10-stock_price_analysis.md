Here's some basic text.

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** texts.

What about a [link](https://github.com/erenat77)

Here's a bulleted list:
* First
+ seconds
- Third

Here is numbered list
1. First
2. second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
  import numpy as np

  def test_func(x,y):
    return np.sum(x,y)
```

Here is some inline code `x+y`.

Here is some math:
$$z=x+y$$
$$z=x/y$$
